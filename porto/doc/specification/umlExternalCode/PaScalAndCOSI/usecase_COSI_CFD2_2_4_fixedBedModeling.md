| Scope                               | Setup and run a CFDEM simulation  for a dense, static particle bed |
| Level                               | End Usage                          |
| Primary Actor                       | Researchers that derive closures for fixed simulations    |
| Stakeholders and Interests          | Engineers and researchers that fixed bed simulations and need to rely on closures |
| Preconditions                       | Physical and chemical data, particle properties, as well as boundary conditions are defined.  |
| Success Guarantee                   | Derived closures agree with available data, effect of numerical parameters, e.g., grid resolution, is small |
| Main Success Scenario               | Simulation have completed with no errors, data for closures is analyzed by C3PO, and model is handed over to Soft for further processing  |
