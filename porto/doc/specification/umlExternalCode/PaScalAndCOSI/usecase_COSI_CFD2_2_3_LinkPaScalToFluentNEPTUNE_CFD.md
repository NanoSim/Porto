| Use Case Name                       | Use the PaScal and C3PO library in an ANSYS Fluent and NEPTUNE_CFD simulation     |
| Scope                               | Load PaScal and C3PO library during ANSYS Fluent and NEPTUNE_CFD run  |
| Level                               | End Usage                          |
| Primary Actor                       | Engineers in industry, researchers using NEPTUNE_CFD  |
| Stakeholders and Interests          | Engineers and researchers that use ANSYS Fluent and NEPTUNE_CFD for predictive simulations in complex geometries |
| Preconditions                       | Physical and chemical data, boundary conditions, as well as ANSYS Fluent or NEPTUNE_CFD setup is available, and coordinated with a similar setup for COSI |
| Success Guarantee                   |   ANSYS Fluent and NEPTUNE_CFD can exchange information with PaScal and C3PO during a simulation |
| Main Success Scenario               | Simulation results match reference simulations performed with COSI  |
| Extensions                          | Large deviation to reference simulation using COSI, data exchange does not work, PaScal and/or C3PO library cannot be linked to ANSYS Fluent and/or NEPTUNE_CFD |
| Special Requirements                | none |
| Technology and Data Variations List | Final report on key results (comparison COSI vs. ANSYS Fluent and NEPTUNE_CFD  |
| Frequency of Occurrence             | in project: very little (only one or a small number of reference simulations planned). For final usage, a link to the PaScal and/or C3PO library might be used on a daily basis.   |
| Miscellaneous  	                    | none  |
