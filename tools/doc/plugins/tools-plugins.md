\brief Gnu Scientific Library javascript SDK

The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical library for C and C++ programmers. It is free software under the GNU General Public License.

The library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random number generators, special functions and least-squares fitting. There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite.

The complete range of subject areas covered by the library includes,

	* Complex Numbers	
	* Roots of Polynomials
	* Special Functions	
	* Vectors and Matrices
	* Permutations	
	* Sorting
	* BLAS Support	
	* Linear Algebra
	* Eigensystems	
	* Fast Fourier Transforms
	* Quadrature	
	* Random Numbers
	* Quasi-Random Sequences	
	* Random Distributions
	* Statistics	
	* Histograms
	* N-Tuples	
	* Monte Carlo Integration
	* Simulated Annealing	
	* Differential Equations
	* Interpolation	Numerical 
	* Differentiation
	* Chebyshev Approximation	
	* Series Acceleration
	* Discrete Hankel Transforms	
	* Root-Finding
	* Minimization	
	* Least-Squares Fitting
	* Physical Constants	
	* IEEE Floating-Point
	* Discrete Wavelet Transforms	
	* Basis splines
	* Running Statistics	
	* Sparse Matrices and Linear Algebra

Unlike the licenses of proprietary numerical libraries the license of GSL does not restrict scientific cooperation. It allows you to share your programs freely with others.

\brief MongoDB javascript SDK

MongoDB (from humongous) is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database. Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB avoids the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and is free and open-source, published under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License. As of July 2015, MongoDB was the fourth most widely mentioned database engine on the web, and the most popular for document stores.
